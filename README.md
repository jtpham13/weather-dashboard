# weather-dashboard


## Description

I used HTML in a way so that I am able to have it later interat with Javascript code. The site is still a work in progress. The style of the site is broken up into 3 parts using css and styling them. When the site is fully function it will allow the user to search for a city and display current weather. Also it will have a section for 5 day forecast.
